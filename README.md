Forecast Error Model for Optimized Storage

The generalisation of renewable energy sources into electricity systems strenghten the need to cope with their fluctuations and their forecast errors. We here suppose that a storage device is used to mitigate this forecast error. The question then becomes how to optimaly control this device. 

The control of a storage device to compensate the forecast errors necessarily depends on the way one choose to model the forecast error signal. Indeed, this modeling will determine the optimal stored power. 

The files of this repository aim at carrying a comparison between several forecast errors models within a virtual power plant context. Each one of the investigated models for the forecast error is used to determine an optimal storage power strategy by the means of stochastic dynamic programming.
